"Source" is a little loose term here in the  * sense it can range from being an HDFS url location pointing to the schema or it can be even as  * simple as a {@link java.util.Properties properties} file with a simple key-value mapping to the schema. For  * cases where the {@link Schema schema} is a part of the serialized data itself, "Source" would  * refer to the data bytes from which the {@link Schema schema} has to retrieved.  *  * */
