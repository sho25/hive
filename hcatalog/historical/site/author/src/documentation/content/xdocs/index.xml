        <title>DISCLAIMER</title>
        <p>Apache HCatalog is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC.  Incubation
        is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process
        have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects.  While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the
        completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.</p>
