comment|/**  * An abstraction of keys within a VectorizedRowBatch.  *  * A key is one or more columns.  *  * When there is a sequential "run" of equal keys, they are collapsed and represented by a  * duplicate count.  *  * The batch of keys (with sequential duplicates collapsed) is called a series.  *  * A key can be all null, or a key with no or some nulls.  *  * All keys have a duplicate count.  *  * A key with no or some nulls has:  *   1) A hash code.  *   2) Key values and other value(s) defined by other interfaces.  *  * The key series is logically indexed.  That is, if batch.selectedInUse is true, the indices  * will be logical and need to be mapped through batch.selected to get the physical batch  * indices.  Otherwise, the indices are physical batch indices.  */
