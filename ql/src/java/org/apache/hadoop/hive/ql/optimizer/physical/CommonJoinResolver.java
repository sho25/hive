comment|/*  * Convert tasks involving JOIN into MAPJOIN.  * If hive.auto.convert.join is true, the tasks involving join are converted.  * Consider the query:  * select .... from T1 join T2 on T1.key = T2.key join T3 on T1.key = T3.key  *  * There is a map-reduce task which performs a 3-way join (T1, T2, T3).  * The task would be converted to a conditional task which would have 4 children  * a. Mapjoin considering T1 as the big table  * b. Mapjoin considering T2 as the big table  * c. Mapjoin considering T3 as the big table  * d. Map-reduce join (the original task).  *  *  Note that the sizes of all the inputs may not be available at compile time. At runtime, it is  *  determined which branch we want to pick up from the above.  *  * However, if hive.auto.convert.join.noconditionaltask is set to true, and  * the sum of any n-1 tables is smaller than hive.auto.convert.join.noconditionaltask.size,  * then a mapjoin is created instead of the conditional task. For the above, if the size of  * T1 + T2 is less than the threshold, then the task is converted to a mapjoin task with T3 as  * the big table.  *  * In this case, further optimization is performed by merging 2 consecutive map-only jobs.  * Consider the query:  * select ... from T1 join T2 on T1.key1 = T2.key1 join T3 on T1.key2 = T3.key2  *  * Initially, the plan would consist of 2 Map-reduce jobs (1 to perform join for T1 and T2)  * followed by another map-reduce job (to perform join of the result with T3). After the  * optimization, both these tasks would be converted to map-only tasks. These 2 map-only jobs  * are then merged into a single map-only job. As a followup (HIVE-3952), it would be possible to  * merge a map-only task with a map-reduce task.  * Consider the query:  * select T1.key2, count(*) from T1 join T2 on T1.key1 = T2.key1 group by T1.key2;  * Initially, the plan would consist of 2 Map-reduce jobs (1 to perform join for T1 and T2)  * followed by another map-reduce job (to perform groupby of the result). After the  * optimization, the join task would be converted to map-only tasks. After HIVE-3952, the map-only  * task would be merged with the map-reduce task to create a single map-reduce task.  */
